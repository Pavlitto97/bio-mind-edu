    'intro': '''
Hello little scientist! Today we're going on an amazing adventure inside a tiny cell!
Cells are the building blocks of all living things - you, me, plants, and animals!
They're so small you need a microscope to see them. But don't worry, we made this one BIG so you can explore!
Each part of the cell has a special job. Let's discover what they do!
Tap on the glowing dots to learn about each part. Ready? Let's go!
''',
    'nucleus': '''
This is the Nucleus - the brain of the cell!
Just like your brain tells your body what to do, the nucleus controls everything in the cell.
Inside the nucleus is something very special called D-N-A. It's like a recipe book that tells the cell how to grow and what to become!
The nucleus has a protective cover called the nuclear membrane, like a castle wall that keeps the DNA safe.
Without the nucleus, the cell wouldn't know what to do! It's the boss!
''',
    'membrane': '''
This is the Cell Membrane - the protective wall!
The membrane is like the skin of the cell. It wraps around everything inside and keeps it safe.
But it's not just a wall - it's like a smart security guard! It decides what can come into the cell and what can go out.
Good things like food and oxygen? Come on in! Bad things or waste? Time to go out!
The membrane is made of tiny building blocks called lipids, arranged in two layers. It's flexible, so the cell can move and change shape!
''',
    'mitochondria': '''
These are Mitochondria - the power plants of the cell!
Mitochondria are like tiny batteries that make energy for the cell. Every cell has many of them!
They take the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe, and turn them into energy the cell can use. This process is called cellular respiration.
Fun fact: Mitochondria have their own DNA! Scientists think they used to be separate tiny creatures millions of years ago!
Without mitochondria, you wouldn't have energy to run, play, or even think! They work day and night to keep you going!
''',
    'cytoplasm': '''
This is the Cytoplasm - the jelly that fills the cell!
Cytoplasm is like a thick jelly or gel that fills up all the space inside the cell.
All the other parts of the cell - the nucleus, mitochondria, and others - float around in this jelly!
The cytoplasm is mostly water, but it also has proteins and nutrients the cell needs.
Think of it like a swimming pool where all the cell parts can move around and do their jobs! It keeps everything organized and in the right place.
''',
    'summary': '''
Wow! You've explored the amazing world inside a cell!
Remember: the Nucleus is the brain, the Membrane is the protective wall, Mitochondria are the power plants, and Cytoplasm is the jelly that holds it all together!
All these parts work together like a team to keep the cell alive and healthy!
Now you know that every living thing is made of these tiny, wonderful cells. Even you have trillions of them working together right now!
Great job, scientist! Ready for the next challenge?

  // ========================================
  // PLANT LESSON NARRATIONS
  // ========================================

  static const Map<String, String> plantLesson = {
    'intro': '''
Hello nature explorer! Today we're learning about the amazing life of plants!
Plants are living things that grow from tiny seeds into big, beautiful forms!
They make their own food using sunlight - isn't that magical?
We're going to follow a plant through its whole life cycle, from a tiny seed to a blooming flower!
Watch how each stage is important and special. Let's begin this green adventure!
''',
    'seed': '''
This is a Seed - where every plant begins!
Seeds might look small and simple, but they're actually amazing! Inside each seed is a baby plant called an embryo, waiting to grow.
The seed also has food stored inside it, like a lunch box for the baby plant! This food is called the endosperm.
Seeds have a tough outer coat called the seed coat. It protects the baby plant inside like armor!
When the seed gets water, warmth, and air, something magical happens - it wakes up and starts to grow! This is called germination.
Some seeds can wait for years before they germinate, waiting for just the right conditions!
''',
    'sprout': '''
Look! It's a Sprout - the baby plant has woken up!
The seed coat has cracked open and a tiny green shoot is reaching up toward the light! This is so exciting!
The first part that comes out is usually a tiny root, called the radicle. It grows down into the soil to find water and anchor the plant.
Then comes the shoot, growing up! The first leaves that appear are called cotyledons - they use the food stored in the seed.
At this stage, the sprout is very delicate and needs lots of care. It needs water, sunlight, and good soil to keep growing strong!
Fun fact: Some sprouts can push through soil and even crack through pavement! They're stronger than they look!
''',
    'growth': '''
Now the plant is in its Growth stage - getting bigger and stronger every day!
The stem grows taller, reaching toward the sun! It's like a highway that carries water from the roots up to the leaves, and food from the leaves down to the rest of the plant.
More and more leaves are opening up! Leaves are like solar panels - they catch sunlight and use it to make food for the plant. This amazing process is called photosynthesis!
Underground, you can't see it, but the roots are growing deeper and spreading out like a web, searching for water and nutrients in the soil.
The plant drinks water through its roots, and loses water through tiny holes in its leaves called stomata. It's like the plant is breathing!
During this stage, the plant is getting ready for something special - to make flowers!
''',
    'bloom': '''
Wow! The plant has reached the Bloom stage - look at those beautiful flowers!
Flowers aren't just pretty to look at - they have a very important job! They help the plant make seeds so new plants can grow.
Flowers have colorful petals to attract insects and birds. When these visitors come for sweet nectar, they carry pollen from flower to flower. This is called pollination!
Inside the flower are special parts: the stamen makes pollen (like plant dust), and the pistil receives the pollen to make seeds.
After pollination, the flower starts to make seeds or fruits. These seeds will eventually fall to the ground or be carried away by wind or animals, and the whole cycle begins again!
This is the circle of life for plants - from seed to sprout to growth to bloom, and back to seed again! Isn't nature amazing?
''',
    'summary': '''
Congratulations, young botanist! You've learned about the complete life cycle of a plant!
Remember the four stages: Seed (the beginning), Sprout (waking up), Growth (getting bigger), and Bloom (making flowers and seeds)!
Plants are so important - they give us oxygen to breathe, food to eat, and make the world beautiful!
Next time you see a plant, think about which stage of life it's in, and remember the amazing journey it took to get there!
You're doing great! Ready to learn more?

  // HEART LESSON NARRATIONS
  // ========================================

  static const Map<String, String> heartLesson = {
    'intro': '''
Hello body explorer! Today we're going to learn about one of the most amazing organs in your body - your Heart!
Your heart is a super strong muscle that never stops working! It beats about 100,000 times every single day!
The heart's job is to pump blood all around your body, delivering oxygen and nutrients to every cell!
Put your hand on your chest - can you feel it beating? That's your heart working hard right now!
Let's explore the four chambers of the heart and discover how blood travels through your body. This is going to be exciting!
''',
    'left_atrium': '''
This is the Left Atrium - one of the upper chambers of the heart!
The left atrium is like a receiving room. It gets fresh, oxygen-rich blood that just came from your lungs!
Your lungs fill the blood with oxygen when you breathe in. Then this super-oxygenated blood flows into the left atrium!
The left atrium has thin walls because it doesn't need to pump very hard - it just passes the blood down to the left ventricle below it.
Between the left atrium and left ventricle is a special door called the mitral valve. It opens to let blood through, then closes so blood can't flow backwards!
The left atrium works together with the right atrium, but they never mix their blood - they're separated by a wall called the septum!
''',
    'left_ventricle': '''
This is the Left Ventricle - the strongest chamber of your heart!
The left ventricle has super thick, muscular walls - it's like the champion weightlifter of the heart!
Why is it so strong? Because it has the biggest job! It pumps oxygen-rich blood to your ENTIRE body - from your head to your toes!
When the left ventricle contracts (squeezes), it pushes blood out through the aorta, the biggest artery in your body. The aorta is like a highway that branches out to deliver blood everywhere!
The left ventricle creates about 120 millimeters of mercury of pressure - that's like trying to squeeze a tube of toothpaste really hard!
This chamber needs to be strong and healthy. That's why exercise is so important - it keeps your heart muscle strong!
''',
    'right_atrium': '''
This is the Right Atrium - the other upper chamber of the heart!
The right atrium receives blood from your whole body. But this blood has already given away its oxygen to your cells, so it needs a refill!
Blood comes into the right atrium through big veins called the superior vena cava (from your upper body) and inferior vena cava (from your lower body).
This chamber collects all the used blood and passes it down to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve - another special one-way door!
The right atrium also has a special area called the sinoatrial node, or SA node. This is like the heart's natural pacemaker - it sends electrical signals that tell your heart when to beat!
Your heartbeat starts here! The SA node is like the conductor of an orchestra, keeping everything in rhythm!
''',
    'right_ventricle': '''
This is the Right Ventricle - the lung specialist!
The right ventricle has an important but slightly easier job than the left ventricle, so its walls are a bit thinner.
Its job is to pump the oxygen-poor blood to your lungs through the pulmonary artery!
In the lungs, something amazing happens! The blood drops off carbon dioxide (the waste gas from your cells) and picks up fresh oxygen. It's like a delivery truck dropping off garbage and picking up supplies!
The right ventricle pumps with less pressure than the left because the lungs are right next to the heart - the blood doesn't have to travel very far!
Between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery is the pulmonary valve - it makes sure blood only flows one way, toward the lungs!
''',
    'summary': '''
Amazing work, body explorer! You've learned how your heart works!
Let's review the journey of blood: 
Used blood enters the Right Atrium, goes to the Right Ventricle, then to the Lungs to get oxygen.
Fresh blood returns to the Left Atrium, moves to the Left Ventricle, which pumps it to your whole body!
This cycle happens over and over, about 100,000 times a day, every day of your life!
Your heart is about the size of your fist, but it's one of the most important organs in your body!
Take care of your heart by eating healthy, exercising, and staying active! Your heart works hard for you, so be kind to it!
Fantastic job learning about the heart! You're becoming a real scientist!
